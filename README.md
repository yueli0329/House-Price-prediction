## Data resource
This a kaggle competition with two datasets, train.csv and test.csv. [link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview)
<br>
**Target variable:** The house price <br>
**Features:** 79 features about the house condistion. 

## Purpose Description 
With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, data preprocessing and Regression random forest model were built to predict the final price of each home. 

## Experiment 
1. **Data Pre-processing**  Missing Value check, Outliner Detection 
2. **Exploration Data Anlysis** Categorical data and Numerical data exploration, Categorical data transform 
3. **Modeling** Decision Tree and Random Forest models
4. **Hyperparameters Tunning** Find hyperparameter space and implement random search CV to find the best combination of parameters
